        <h1>Favorite Gamecube Games</h1>
        <p>This page is to show everyone my favorite past time games. The games are not in a specific order. Hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h3>Mario Kart Double Dash</h3>
        <img src="Pics/MCDD2.jpg" width="890" height="500">
        <p>This was my favorite racing game. I loved playing Mario Kart 64 before this. When the Gamecube came out with this game, I could not stop playing it.</p>
        <h3>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h3>
        <img src="Pics/SSBM.jpg" width="auto" height="500">
        <p>In my opinion, this was the best fighting game to play as a child. The fighting system was great and I got to play as many different nintendo characters all in one game! I've always wondered who would win between Ganondorf and Kirby.</p>
        <h3>Super Mario Sunshine</h3>
        <img src="Pics/SMS.jpg" width="890" height="500">
        <p>The last 3D single player Mario game I played before this was Super Mario 64. I was amazed by the graphics and mechanics of the game. I really enjoyed the story as well.</p>
        <h3>The Lengend of Zelda Twilight Princess</h3>
        <img src="Pics/TLZTP.jpg" width="auto" height="500">
        <p>Hands down one of the best Zelda games made. Not better than Ocarina of Time but still great. If anyone is looking to get into Zelda, I'd recommend this game first.</p>
        <h3>Sonic Heroes</h3>
        <img src="Pics/SH.jpg" width="auto" height="500">
        <p>This was actually my first Sonic game. I think it's a great game to get introduced to the characters. It's also a good challenging game to play.</p>
